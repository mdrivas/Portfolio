# Portfolio

## Local Development

To view the portfolio on your local machine, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the portfolio.

Alternatively, if you're using a local server, run it and visit `http://localhost:port` where `port` is the port number your server uses.
